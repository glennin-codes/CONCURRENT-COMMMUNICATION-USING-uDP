#Title: Registration Number and Serial Number Sender using UDP

Description: This project demonstrates a simple client-server application that sends registration number and serial number data to a server using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and waits for a response from the server.

The client program prompts the user to enter a registration number and a serial number. It then sends this data to the server using UDP sockets. The server receives the data, performs any necessary operations, and sends a response back to the client.

This project showcases the basic usage of UDP for communication between a client and server, as well as how to handle data transmission and reception. It can serve as a starting point for building more complex client-server applications using UDP.
